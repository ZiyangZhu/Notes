#### The following notes are written in Chinese.

##### **[Representation Theory I: The Case of Finite Groups](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538488/RTFG.pdf)** _Update: August 25, 2020_
This note aims to introduce the representation theory of finite groups, including unitary representation, character theory, Fourier transformation, Burnside theorem, induced representations, etc. It can be read on the basis of linear algebra and abstract algebra, but it may be a little boring to read.

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory I: Galois Theory](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538510/Galois.pdf)** _Update: August 25, 2020_
This is a note to introduce Galois theory, including polynomial theory, the fundamental theorem and its applications, infinite Galois extensions and transcendental extensions. You can read it with the foundation of algebra and topology.

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory II: The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538520/EC.pdf)** _Update: June 22, 2021_
This note is the special introduction of "Riemann Surfaces",  it does not involve proof, but mainly introduces the concept of elliptic curves, modular forms, Mordell theorem, B-SD conjecture and other basic contents.

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory III: Tate's Thesis](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538531/Tate.pdf)** _Update: November 06, 2021_
This is the lecture note of the course "Arithmetic Geometry" at CNU, 2021. The main contents include locally compact groups and their representation theory, abstract harmonic analysis, Fourier transformation and Gelfand transformation, Pontryagin duality and Poisson summation formula, profinite groups, adeles and ideles, Tate's thesis, modular forms, Galois representations and automorphic forms, etc.

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory VI: Arithmetic Dynamics](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538546/default.pdf)** _Update: November 13, 2021_
Dynamical system is a subject that studies the iteration by means of statistics, it also connects to the number theory. This note consists of four topics: ergodic theory, Oppenheim conjecture, entropies and geometric topology of moduli spaces. This is the lecture note of the course "Dynamical Systems" at CNU, 2021.

##### **[Introduction to Real Analysis](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538541/RA.pdf)** _Update: June 22, 2021_
This is a note on real variable functions. It originated from the final exam of the course in a diploma mill in Nanjing. It introduces the elementary theory of real analysis briefly.
