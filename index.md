#### The following notes are written in Chinese.

##### **[Representation Theory I: The Case of Finite Groups](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538488/RTFG.pdf)**
This note aims to introduce the representation theory of finite groups, including unitary representation, character theory, Fourier transformation, Burnside theorem, induced representations, etc. It can be read on the basis of linear algebra and abstract algebra, but it may be a little boring to read. _Update: August 25, 2020_.

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory I: Galois Theory](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538510/Galois.pdf)**
This is a note to introduce Galois theory, including polynomial theory, the fundamental theorem and its applications, infinite Galois expansion and transcendental extensions. You can read it with the foundation of algebra and topology. _Update: August 25, 2020_

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory II: The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538520/EC.pdf)**
This note is the special introduction of Riemann surfaces and complex geometry,  it does not involve proof, but mainly introduces the concept of elliptic curves, modular forms, Mordell theorem, B-SD conjecture and other basic contents. _Update: June 22, 2021_

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory III: Tate's Thesis](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538531/Tate.pdf)**
This is the lecture note of the course "arithmetic geometry" at CNU, 2021. The main contents include locally compact groups and their representation theory, abstract harmonic analysis, Fourier transformation and Gelfand transformation, Pontryagin duality and Poisson summation formula, profinite groups, adeles and ideles, Tate's thesis , modular forms, Galois representations and automorphic forms, etc. _Update: 2021.11.06_

##### **[Algebraic Number Theory VI: Arithmetic Dynamics](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538546/default.pdf)**
Dynamical system is a subject that studies the iteration by means of statistics, it also connects to the number theory. This note consists of four topics: ergodic theory, Oppenheim conjecture, entropies and geometric topology of moduli spaces. This is the lecture note of the course "Dynamical Systems" at CNU, 2021.

##### **[Introduction to Real Analysis](https://github.com/ZiyangZhu/Notes/files/7538541/RA.pdf)**
This is a note on real variable functions. It originated from the final exam of the course in a trade school in Nanjing. It introduces the elementary theory of real analysis briefly. _Update: June 22, 2021_
